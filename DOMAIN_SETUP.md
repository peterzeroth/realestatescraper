# Switch to domain.com.au Scraper

Domain.com.au has much better success rates! Here's how to use it:

## âœ… Already Done

I've created `src/domain-main.js` - a specialized scraper for domain.com.au that:
- âœ… Has LESS aggressive anti-bot protection than realestate.com.au
- âœ… Accepts addresses and auto-searches for properties
- âœ… Extracts property links from search results
- âœ… Scrapes property details from listing pages
- âœ… Uses shorter delays (2-5 seconds instead of 10-20)
- âœ… Configured as default scraper

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

The scraper is already configured as the default. Just use one of these inputs:

### Option 1: Search by Address (Recommended)

```json
{
  "addresses": [
    "59 whitsunday dr kirwan",
    "123 main st sydney"
  ],
  "maxRequestsPerCrawl": 50,
  "proxyConfiguration": {
    "useApifyProxy": true,
    "apifyProxyGroups": ["RESIDENTIAL"],
    "apifyProxyCountry": "AU"
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Direct URLs

```json
{
  "startUrls": [
    {
      "url": "https://www.domain.com.au/59-whitsunday-drive-kirwan-qld-4817-2020372212"
    }
  ],
  "maxRequestsPerCrawl": 50,
  "proxyConfiguration": {
    "useApifyProxy": true,
    "apifyProxyGroups": ["RESIDENTIAL"],
    "apifyProxyCountry": "AU"
  }
}
```

## ðŸ“Š How It Works

### With Addresses:
1. Converts address to search URL: `https://www.domain.com.au/sale/?excludeunderoffer=1&street=59+whitsunday+dr+kirwan`
2. Scrapes search results page
3. Finds property listing links (e.g., `.address.is-two-lines`)
4. Visits each property page
5. Extracts full details

### With Direct URLs:
1. Goes straight to property page
2. Extracts details
3. Done!

## ðŸ“¦ Data Extracted

From domain.com.au property pages:

```json
{
  "url": "https://www.domain.com.au/59-whitsunday-drive-kirwan-qld-4817-2020372212",
  "address": "59 Whitsunday Drive",
  "suburb": "Kirwan",
  "state": "QLD",
  "postcode": "4817",
  "fullAddress": "59 Whitsunday Drive, Kirwan QLD 4817",
  "priceText": "Offers over $730,000",
  "price": 730000,
  "propertyType": "House",
  "bedrooms": 4,
  "bathrooms": 3,
  "parkingSpaces": 2,
  "landSize": 700,
  "listingId": "2020372212",
  "scrapedAt": "2025-10-28T..."
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Selectors Used

Based on the HTML you provided:

- **Price**: `[data-testid="listing-details__summary-title"] span`
- **Address**: `h1` in `[data-testid="listing-details__button-copy-wrapper"]`
- **Bedrooms**: Text before "Beds" in `[data-testid="property-features-wrapper"]`
- **Bathrooms**: Text before "Baths"
- **Parking**: Text before "Parking"
- **Land Size**: Text with "mÂ²"
- **Property Type**: `[data-testid="listing-summary-property-type"] span`
- **Listing ID**: Last digits in URL

## âš¡ Performance

- **Delays**: 2-5 seconds (much faster than realestate.com.au)
- **Success Rate**: Should be high (domain.com.au is easier)
- **Speed**: ~10 properties per minute

## ðŸ”„ Switching Between Scrapers

You have 3 scrapers available:

1. **domain.com.au** (DEFAULT): `npm start` or `npm run start:domain`
2. **realestate.com.au** (HTTP): `npm run start:realestate`
3. **realestate.com.au** (Browser): `npm run start:browser`

To switch default, change `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node src/domain-main.js"  // Change this line
}
```

## ðŸ§ª Test It

1. **Build** the actor on Apify
2. **Run** with test input:

```json
{
  "addresses": ["59 whitsunday dr kirwan"],
  "maxRequestsPerCrawl": 5,
  "proxyConfiguration": {
    "useApifyProxy": true,
    "apifyProxyGroups": ["RESIDENTIAL"],
    "apifyProxyCountry": "AU"
  }
}
```

3. **Check** the dataset for results!

## âœ¨ Why domain.com.au is Better

|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Anti-bot | Moderate | Extreme |
| 429 Errors | Rare | Constant |
| Delays Needed | 2-5s | 10-20s |
| Success Rate | High | Low |
| Proxy Cost | Lower | Higher |

## ðŸŽ‰ You're Ready!
